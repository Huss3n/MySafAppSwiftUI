# MySafAppSwiftUI
Welcome to the MySafaricom Clone repository! This project is a SwiftUI-based clone of the popular MySafaricom app, which is widely used by Kenyans and owned by Safaricom.
The clone aims to replicate the UI functionalities of the original app, with the added integration of the Gemini package to imitate the Zuri assistant feature.

## Important Notice:
This project is a clone created solely for educational purposes and should not be used for actual monetary transactions or to deceive users of the official MySafaricom app.

## Introduction
This project is an attempt to create a functional replica of the MySafaricom app using SwiftUI. The original MySafaricom app provides a range of services including airtime purchase, data bundle subscriptions, and access to M-PESA services. The clone includes these key features, alongside a custom-built assistant similar to Zuri, facilitated by the Gemini package.

## Features
Airtime Purchase: Buy airtime directly from the app view.
Data Bundles: Subscribe to various data plans.
M-PESA Services: Access M-PESA features including sending and receiving money.
Zuri Assistant Clone: Integrated using the Gemini package to assist users with various tasks and provide information.
